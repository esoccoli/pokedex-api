# Web Scraper for Pokedex API

Simple web scraper made in Node.JS to scrape the data that will be needed for the database used by the API. Uses the node-scrapy library to fetch the data and parse it into JSON format.

>[!IMPORTANT]
Be respectful when scraping. Remember to rate limit your requests and cache your data. Above all else, use common sense, and don't be a jerk.
